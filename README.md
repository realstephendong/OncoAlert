HOW TO USE:
--------------------------------------------------------------
Please ensure you install all required dependencies before using this program.
--------------------------------------------------------------
The "assets" folder is used for running main.py. main.py is a Python file that trains the ML model with photos in the train folder. It will then iterate through the validate folder which contains a bunch of randomized test images to test itself which will provide an accuracy score as well as a confusion matrix graph. 

To use the program, upload different categories of images as different folders under the "train" folder. These images will be used to train the model to understand the features of each category. The folder should already have empty folders that serve as an example of what this process may look like when it's finished. Under each of these category folders, you may upload anything similar to the category. For example, the "dog" folder should contain pictures of dogs. 

The validate folder should contain category folders that contain identical names to the folders you created under assets/train. However, these folders should only include examples that are different from the ones chosen in  assets/train, allowing the model to test itself. 

The "assets1" folder is used for running server.py, which is the backend flask server used to connect the front-end functionality. You'll notice that the assets1 folder also contains a train and validate folder. In the train folder, follow the same process described for the "assets" folder. However, leave the validate folder empty as the files the user will upload in the front will be uploaded into assets1/validate/user for the program to use. 

To initiate the react app, you will need to cd into the client folder by using the command `cd client` in your terminal. Once you are in the client, run the command `npm start`. (Ensure you have all the dependencies required installed in the node modules folder)

To initiate the flask server, you will need to create a virtual environment file (venv) file inside the backend folder. To do this, run the command `python -m venv venv`. Once the virtual environment has been created, you will need to activate it by running `./venv/Scripts/activate`. Once the virtual environment has been activated, ensure you have the dependencies for the ML program installed in the venv folder. Once this is completed, run `python server.py` to start the flask server.

Once the react and flask server are running, test the program out! In the React app, navigate to the test page and upload a file. When you click upload, an alert will pop up to tell you if the upload is successful. You can check assets1/validate/user to ensure the file was properly uploaded. Once the file is uploaded, click the ANALYZE button to see your result. The app will take some time to run but will eventually update the diagnosis label to its predicted result. When you are finished, delete the uploaded file in assets1/validate/user to run the program again. 

Happy diagnosing with OncoAlert!
